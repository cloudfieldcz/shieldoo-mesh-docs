# Shieldoo Secure Network

Shieldoo Secure Network is a software-defined end-to-end encrypted peer-to-peer overlay private network. This means you connect your devices securely over the Internet, but they can talk using your local Wifi to exchange data when possible.

The network is built upon [Nebula](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula) by [Slack](https://github.com/slackhq). The underlying technology is lengthy, and some experts must do the setup correctly.
