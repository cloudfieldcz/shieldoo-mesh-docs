## Connect to Shieldoo Secure Network
This section describes the process of establishing a secure connection to a server and attached services in Shieldoo Secure Network.

- __Servers__ are devices that users or other servers can connect to.
- __Attached Services__ are a device that runs on the local network of a server, but on which Shieldoo Secure Network cannot be installed (e.g. a printer). Shieldoo allows you to connect to such services directly without having to connect to their servers first. These services are managed by the admin of Shieldoo Secure Network.

### Connect to Servers
After successful download and install the Shieldoo client, you can now securely connect to any server in Shieldoo Secure Network enabled to you by your administrator. 

To see the list of available servers, click on the client status icon in the system tray ![](../../images/ConnectMe13.png) and choose __My Access Rights In Shieldoo network__.

### Connect to Attached Services
The method of connecting to an attached service depends on the type of the given service.
Here are the general steps:
1. Connect to your Shieldoo Secure Network by client.
Learn how to do that in the [Connect Me](/connect_me/) chapter.
2. Go to the **Connect Me** | **My Access Rights** section to see which servers are available to you.
3. Expand the row of a server that has any attached services configured.
4. Connect to an attached service by utilizing the IP address of the given server and the service port of the attached service.
