# Connect to a Attached Services
## Attached Services
An attached service is a device that runs on the local network of a server (configured in Shieldoo Secure Network), but on which Shieldoo cannot be installed (e.g. a printer).

Shieldoo allows you to connect to such services directly without having to connect to their servers first. These services are managed by the administrator of Shieldoo Secure Network.

{: .tip }
> For a specific instructions how to set such service, see the [Attached Services](https://docs.shieldoo.io/attached_services/) chapter.

## Connecting to Attached Services
The method of connecting to an attached service depends on the type of the given service.
Here are the general steps:
1. Connect to your Shieldoo network as a client.
Learn how to do that in the [Connect Me](https://docs.shieldoo.io/connect_me/) chapter.
2. Go to the __Devices | My Access Rights__ section to see which servers are available to you.
3. Expand the row of a server that has any attached services configured to see the servicesâ€™ listen ports.
4. Connect to an attached service by utilizing the IP address of the given server and the listen port of the attached service.
