# Shieldoo Mesh
Shieldoo Mesh is a private secure network. 

It is software defined end-to-end encrypted peer-to-peer overlay network. Which means that you connect your devices securely over the Internet, but they can talk using just your local Wifi to exchange data when possible.

The network is build upon [Nebula](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula) by [Slack](https://github.com/slackhq). The underlying technology is lenghty to set up and it needs some experts to do the setup properly. Shieldoo Mesh comes with a slick UI, automatic deployment in cloud and many more features that are missing from [Nebula](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula) itself.

- Non-expert: Ability to set up in a few clicks.
