# Shieldoo Mesh
Shieldoo Mesh is a private secure network. 

It is a software defined end-to-end encrypted peer-to-peer overlay network. That means you connect your devices securely over the Internet, allowing them to talk using just your local Wifi to exchange data when possible.

The network is built upon [Nebula](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula) by [Slack](https://github.com/slackhq). The underlying technology is lenghty to set up, requiring deep expertise to do properly. Shieldoo Mesh comes with a slick UI, automatic deployment in cloud and additional features that are missing from [Nebula](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula) itself. 

Shieldoo Mesh brings the following benefits to its users:
- For non-experts - The ability to set up in a few clicks.
- For experts - Simplicity, speed and comfort.
