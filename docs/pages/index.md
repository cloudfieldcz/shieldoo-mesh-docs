# Shieldoo Mesh
Shieldoo Mesh is a private secure network. 

It is an end-to-end encrypted peer-to-peer overlay network. That means you connect your devices securely over the Internet, allowing them to communicate with each other using just your local Wi-Fi.

The network is built upon [Nebula](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula) by [Slack](https://github.com/slackhq). The underlying technology is lenghty to set up, requiring deep expertise to do properly. Shieldoo Mesh comes with a slick UI, automatic deployment in cloud and additional features that are missing from [Nebula](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula) itself. 

Shieldoo Mesh brings the following benefits to its users:
- For non-experts - Ability to set up in a few clicks.
- For experts - Simplicity, speed and comfort.

To learn about Shieldoo Mesh in detail, see the following role-specific chapters:
