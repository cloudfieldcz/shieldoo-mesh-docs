## Servers
Servers in a Shieldoo Mesh network are devices that users or other servers can connect to.

To learn how to install servers in your Shieldoo Mesh network, see the [Servers](/servers/) chapter.

## Users
Users in a Shieldoo Mesh network are clients that can connect to servers.

To learn how to invite users to your Shieldoo Mesh network, see the [Users](/users/) chapter.

## Access Management Features
The following features allow you to manage access to services running in your Shieldoo Mesh network:
- __Groups__ - A group is a mechanism that maps specific firewall rules to specific users or servers.
- __Firewalls__ - A firewall configures rules that determine which groups can access which services running on the network. 
- __Access Cards__ - An access card maps firewall rules and groups to specific servers or users. In other words, it determines which services users or servers can access within the network.

To learn more about the listed features, see the [Access Management](/access_management/#groups) chapter.
