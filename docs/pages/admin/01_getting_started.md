# Getting Started
This chapter introduces the concepts important for the administrators of your Shieldoo Mesh network.

## Administration Modes
Shieldoo Mesh provides administrators with the following configuration modes:
- __Simple Mode__ - Allows you to quickly set up your network without configuring any restrictions. By default, all nodes (users or server) will be able to access each other.
- __Expert Mode__ - Allows advanced users to secure the network by establishing rules for filtering incoming and outgoing traffic passing between the network and its nodes (users and servers).  

## Servers
Servers in a Shieldoo Mesh network are devices that users or other servers can connect to.

To learn how to install servers in your Shieldoo Mesh network, see the [Servers](/servers/) chapter.

## Users
Users in a Shieldoo Mesh network are clients that can connect to servers.

To learn how to invite users to your Shieldoo Mesh network, see the [Users](/users/) chapter.

## Access Management Features
The following features allow you to secure your Shieldoo Mesh network:
- __Groups__ - A group is a mechanism that maps specific firewall rules to specific nodes (users and servers).
- __Firewalls__ - A firewall configures rules that determine which traffic can pass between the network and its nodes (users and servers). 
- __Access Cards__ - An access card maps firewall rules and groups to specific nodes (servers and users).  
In other words, it determines what nodes can access within the network.

To learn more about the listed features, see the [Access Management](/access_management/#groups) chapter.
