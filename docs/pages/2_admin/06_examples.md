## Sharing a Printer
This example shows how to share a printer with the clients in your Shieldoo network. To do this, the printer must run within the local network of a server connected to the Shieldoo network.

Follow these steps:
1. Install the server on whose local network the printer is running in your Shieldoo Secure Network.  
Learn how to do that in the [Servers](/servers/) chapter.
2. Configure a connection to the printer as a service attached to the installed server.  
Learn how to do that in the [Attached Services](/attached_services/) chapter.
3. Configure who can access the printer via server firewall rules.  
Learn how to do that in the [Access Management](/access_management/) chapter.
4. Connect to your Shieldoo network as a client with access to the printer (i.e. a client whose access to the printer is not blocked by Shieldoo firewall rules).  
Learn how to do that in the [Connect Me](/connect_me/) chapter.
5. Check that the operating system of your client's computer has automatically registered the shared printer.  
For example, the printer should become immediately visible on Windows in the __Printers & scanners__ settings.
1. Use that printer to start printing documents remotely.
